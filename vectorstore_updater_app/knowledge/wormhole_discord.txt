If you proceed to transfer, your transfer may be subject to delays of up to 24 hours in redeeming on the target chain.thread: Error: "The daily notional value limit for transfers on <chain> has been exceeded.", answer: This means the daily notional value limit has been reached. If you’ve selected the relayer, the funds will be released when the transfer goes through. If you did not select the relayer, you’ll need to manually try to redeem your tokens periodically.

Check out how to manually add your token into your wallet here: https://portalbridge.com/docs/video-tutorials/how-to-manually-add-tokens-to-your-walletthread: I bridged <token> but cannot swap it now. No DEX has liquid markets., answer: You have bridged a token, which has no liquidity on the target chain. You will need to use Portal bridge to bridge this one back. You can do this by pasting the token contract address (which you can find in your wallet or with your address in the blockchains explorer) into the Portal “select a token” search field. 
You can find a comprehensive overview of liquid markets: https://portalbridge.com/docs/faqs/liquid-marketsthread: The recipient address is not my wallet address! (Solana), answer: This is because the recipient address shows the associated token account that is created within your Solana address. Unlike other blockchains, Solana requires you to create a new address for each token you own. When you click the associated token account address, you can find your Solana address as “owner".
